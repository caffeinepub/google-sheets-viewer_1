      "featureTitle": "Fix the row hover highlight (left border stripe and background color change) in the SheetViewer table so it is visible on mobile devices. On touch/mobile screens, CSS :hover pseudo-class does not trigger on tap; replace or supplement the hover-based highlight with a tap/touch-activated highlight using a React state-driven approach (e.g., onTouchStart/onTouchEnd or onClick toggling an 'active' class on the row) so that tapping a row visibly highlights it with the colored left border stripe and background color on mobile. The hover effect should continue to work on desktop as before.",
