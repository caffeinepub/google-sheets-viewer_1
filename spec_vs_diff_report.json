The SheetViewer.tsx file introduces a HIDDEN_COL_INDEX constant (set to 5), computes visibleHeaders and visibleRows via useMemo to filter out column index 5, and uses these filtered arrays for all rendering (header row, data rows, and the row/column count summary). All acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",
