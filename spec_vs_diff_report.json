  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-11 by adding React state (activeRow) to SheetViewer.tsx, using onClick to toggle the active row highlight, and applying inline styles for the green left-border stripe and background color on active rows. Desktop hover is handled via onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave. Zebra striping is preserved via getRowStyle. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
